# About Adopting Bitcoin 

The Bitcoin Law leveled the playing field between Bitcoin and the Dollar in El Salvador. Salvadorans went from 70% unbanked to having the option of using Bitcoin as money. This novel situation comes with both, the challenge to onboard users, and the opportunity to learn from them for the benefit of the entire ecosystem - from protocol and application devs to entrepreneurs and investors. A successful adoption of Bitcoin at this scale will be a historic milestone that could benefit both Salvadorans and the Bitcoin ecosystem for years to come, and serve as a blueprint for peoples that want to follow the footprint of Salvadorans.

The event aims to connect Bitcoin and Lightning businesses, developers, and the local community. We will create a space for hands-on collaboration through workshops and hackerspaces that will explore:  
- The challenges faced to onboard users.
- The opportunity to learn from the Salvadoran experience  for the benefit of the entire ecosystem
- The blueprint to ensure the successful adoption of Bitcoin at a nation scale 

## Why?

We believe Bitcoin is the best money and that its adoption is a net benefit to the world. 

## How?
