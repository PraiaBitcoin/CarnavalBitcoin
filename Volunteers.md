We have been blessed with an amazing team of volunteers who help with the variety of on-site operations, and the conference wouldnâ€™t be such a success without them!

Volunteering at Adopting Bitcoin only requires a few hours distributed over 3 days and is a great way to meet the community, learn about how to run an event, and of course you also get a free ticket to the conference!

Here are the different volunteers roles we're looking for this year! We're hoping that maybe you can get inspired to help us with them!
