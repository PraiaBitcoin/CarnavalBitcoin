We have been blessed with an amazing team of volunteers who help with the variety of on-site operations, and the conference wouldn’t be such a success without them!

Volunteering at Adopting Bitcoin only requires a few hours distributed over 3 days and is a great way to meet the community, learn about how to run an event, and of course you also get a free ticket to the conference!

Here are the different volunteers roles we're looking for this year! We're hoping that maybe you can get inspired to help us with them!

# MAIN VOLUNTEERS ROLES:

## REGISTRATION STAFF

Registration staff is responsible for checking people into the conference. The flow is straight forward:
- Download an app called PretixScan

A speaker runner is responsible for finding the speakers, and making sure their tech check is done on time. All speakers need to be in the stage where they will be presenting about 20 minutes before they go on stage. Their tech check needs to be conducted, and they need to be introduced to the MC and sat at the front seat of the stage. 

Speaker Runner Checklist:
